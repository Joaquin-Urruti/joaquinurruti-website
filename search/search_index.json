I'm Joaqu\u00edn!</p> <p>I'm a GIS and AI consultant from Argentina. I work with agricultural companies and technical organizations facing the challenge of translating data capabilities and AI innovation into operational efficiency and competitive advantage.</p> <p>Most recently, I led the Innovation and Development department at Espartina S.A., an Argentinian agricultural production company with more than 2.000 fields and 150.000 hectares of land, driving its transformation toward an AI First model by leveraging technology, data, and artificial intelligence to create meaningful impact on decisions, processes, and people. We automated the analysis of new fields for leasing, scaled precision management zones from 50,000 to 150,000, achieved processing of 100% of yield monitor data, automated 100% of field trial processing, and implemented AI-driven automation to interpret the statistical analysis results of those trials.</p> <p>Before that, I led the GIS division at Espartina, developing tools and automating workflows for managing and analyzing spatial and productive data. Prior to that, I worked as a Senior Data Analyst for Major Accounts at S4 Agtech, a Buenos Aires\u2013based company specializing in parametric drought insurance for agriculture. In that position, I combined commercial and analytical responsibilities, helping clients understand their portfolio risk through satellite data and vegetation indices, and explaining how parametric insurance coverage could minimize those risks. We worked directly with re-insurers like Munich Re across Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, translating complex geospatial analytics into actionable risk management strategies.</p> <p>With a solid background in GIS, Python programming, Google Earth Engine, and PostGIS-backed database development, I design and implement innovation strategies that integrate geospatial data science, remote sensing, process automation, and AI-driven optimization. My focus is always on efficiency, scalability, and ensuring that solutions are truly adopted by the teams that use them.</p> <p>I'm an Agronomic Engineer from Buenos Aires University with a Master's in Open Source GIS and postgraduate studies in Agribusiness, Data Science, and Blockchain.</p> <p>Beyond agriculture and technology, I have explored the applications of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in fintech and ag-tech, and I maintain a strong creative side through music. I studied jazz trumpet for several years and performed as a soloist in different professional big bands and small jazz combos. I have also played the piano since the age of six, focusing on classical, romantic, and impressionist repertoire \u2014 an artistic journey that has deeply shaped my discipline, sensitivity, and creativity.</p>"},{"location":"#why-work-with-me","title":"Why work with me?","text":"<p>Here's what sets me apart and how I can help drive value for your business:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Proven Business Experience</p> <p>I come from a farming family and have an agronomy background and a career built around agricultural operations, I translate business needs into clear, actionable solutions, making the bridge between \u201cwhat the farm needs\u201d and \u201cwhat we build\u201d fast, natural, and frictionless.</p> </li> <li> <p> Educator &amp; Communicator</p> <p>My experience as a content creator and educator means I can break down complex technical concepts into clear, actionable insights.

This gives us enough time to understand your data, implement solutions, and deliver actionable results. We can start with a small pilot project to ensure we're a good fit.</p> What industries do you have experience in? <p>I've successfully delivered projects across agriculture operations, administrations, farm valuations and parametric insurance services. While I specialize in AI, geospatial and remote sensing, I also apply my AI and python knowledge in projects involving all company areas.</p> How do you handle data security and confidentiality? <p>I take data security extremely seriously. I sign comprehensive NDAs before starting any project, use enterprise-grade encryption for all data transfers, and follow industry best practices for data handling. I can also work within your existing security infrastructure and policies.</p> What's your pricing structure? <p>I offer both project-based and retainer pricing models. Project fees are based on scope, complexity, and value delivered rather than hours worked. For ongoing support, I offer flexible retainer packages, and I can also provide ongoing support on an hourly basis when that\u2019s a better fit for your needs.
