## About me

Hi! I'm Joaquín!

I'm a geospatial data, [GIS](#GIS "Geospatial Information Systems") and [AI](#AI "Artificial Intelligence") consultant from Argentina. I work with agricultural companies, start-ups and technical organizations facing the challenge of translating data capabilities and AI innovation into operational efficiency and competitive advantage.

I recently led the Innovation and Development department at Espartina S.A., an Argentinian agricultural production company with more than 2,000 lots and 150,000 hectares of land, driving its transformation toward a maximum efficiency model, leveraging technology, data, and artificial intelligence to create meaningful impact on decisions, processes, and people. We automated the analysis of new fields for leasing, scaled precision management zones from 50,000 to 150,000 hectares, achieved processing of 100% of yield monitor data, automated 100% of field trial processing, and implemented AI-driven automation to interpret the statistical analysis results of those trials.

</di**v>

Before that, I led the GIS division at Espartina, developing tools and automating workflows for managing and analyzing spatial and productive data. Prior to that, I worked as a commercial analyst for major accounts at S4 Agtech, a Buenos Aires–based company specializing in parametric drought insurance for agriculture. In that position, I combined commercial and analytical responsibilities, helping clients understand their portfolio risk through satellite data and vegetation indices, and explaining how parametric insurance coverage could minimize those risks. We worked directly with re-insurers like Munich Re across Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, translating complex geospatial analytics into actionable risk management strategies.

With a solid background in GIS, Python programming, Google Earth Engine, and Postgres/PostGIS database development, I design and implement innovation strategies that integrate geospatial data science, remote sensing, process automation, and AI-driven optimization. My focus is always on efficiency, scalability, and ensuring that solutions are truly adopted by the teams that use them.

I'm an Agronomic Engineer from Buenos Aires University with a Master's in Open Source GIS and postgraduate studies in Agribusiness, Data Science, and Blockchain.

Beyond agriculture and technology, I have explored the applications of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in fintech and ag-tech, and I maintain a strong creative side through music. I studied jazz trumpet for several years and performed as a soloist in different professional big bands and small jazz combos. I have also played the piano since the age of six, focusing on classical, romantic, and impressionist repertoire — an artistic journey that has deeply shaped my discipline, sensitivity, and creativity.

## Frequently asked questions

??? note "How quickly can you start working on my project?"
    I can typically begin new projects within 1-2 weeks of contract signing. For urgent matters, I maintain some flexibility for rapid response situations and can potentially start sooner - just let me know your timeline during our initial consultation.

??? note "Do you require a minimum project size or commitment?"
    While I can accommodate projects of any size, I find that engagements of at least 20 hours allow for meaningful impact. This gives us enough time to understand your data, implement solutions, and deliver actionable results. We can start with a small pilot project to ensure we're a good fit.

??? note "What industries do you have experience in?"
    I've successfully delivered projects across agriculture operations, administrations, farm valuations and parametric insurance services. While I specialize in AI, geospatial and remote sensing, I also apply my AI and python knowledge in projects involving all company areas.

??? note "How do you handle data security and confidentiality?"
    I take data security extremely seriously. I sign comprehensive NDAs before starting any project, use enterprise-grade encryption for all data transfers, and follow industry best practices for data handling. I can also work within your existing security infrastructure and policies.

??? note "What's your pricing structure?"
    I offer both project-based and retainer pricing models. Project fees are based on scope, complexity, and value delivered rather than hours worked. For ongoing support, I offer flexible retainer packages, and I can also provide ongoing support on an hourly basis when that’s a better fit for your needs. Let’s discuss your specific requirements during our consultation to determine the most cost-effective approach.

??? note "How do you communicate progress and results?"
    I maintain clear communication through weekly progress updates and regular check-in meetings. You'll receive detailed documentation of all analyses, findings, and recommendations.
